### The easiest way to manage transactions status on your dapp

- 🍻 Prebuilt status notifications toasts (pending, confirmed, failed)
- 🙆‍♀️ Customizable, you can theme the prebuilt components or create one of your own
- ✨ Framework agnostic core at `@concave/txs-core`
- 📦 Tiny tiny, the core package is `1.39 kB gzipped`, with the react adapter `2.68 kB`
  and with a built in notification component it increases about `2 kB`
